This repository features python projects I've done for Angela Yu's python course, and each subdirectory is a standalone mini-project. While I pushed these files to GitHub on 08.02.2024, these projects were done during the year 2022, hence some of them are outdated as they use deprecated functions, there have been changes to the APIs and such.
